## System Architecture
The architecture of the Laundry-App is based on a modular design to ensure maintainability and scalability. Below is an ER diagram representing the core database relationships:

![ER Diagram](path/to/er-diagram.png)

The system architecture follows a client-server model where the mobile client interacts with Firebase as the backend for data storage and authentication. Key components include:

- **User Authentication Module**: Manages login and signup processes.
- **Order Management System**: Handles the lifecycle of user orders.
- **Cart and Product Module**: Manages the selection and adjustment of laundry services.

## Workflow / Process Explanation
The application follows a structured workflow to handle user interactions and service management:

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in or sign up using Firebase authentication services.
2. **Service Selection**: Users browse the product list and add desired services to their cart.
3. **Cart Management**: Users adjust item quantities, review their cart, and schedule pickups.
4. **Order Process**: Finalize orders with real-time database updates.
5. **Order Tracking**: Display order status and details post-confirmation.
